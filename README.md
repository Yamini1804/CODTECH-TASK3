The Personal Portfolio Webpage is a responsive single-page website designed to showcase a developer's skills, projects, and contact information in a professional and visually appealing layout. Featuring a modern blue color theme, the webpage incorporates various shades of blue to create a cohesive design, with accents of yellow for hover effects and links to enhance interactivity. The layout begins with a welcoming hero section, followed by an About section that highlights the developer’s skills and passion for web development. A prominent Projects section showcases the developer’s work, including sample projects like a real-time chat application and an e-commerce website, each accompanied by a brief description. The Contact section provides essential details such as email and LinkedIn links, enabling visitors to easily connect with the developer. Additionally, the webpage includes a sticky navigation bar for seamless transitions between sections and a minimalistic footer with copyright information. Built with HTML and CSS, the portfolio ensures a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes, making it accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. By focusing on clean typography, consistent colors, and user-friendly navigation, this portfolio serves as an excellent platform for developers to present their skills, projects, and professional details to potential employers or clients.
